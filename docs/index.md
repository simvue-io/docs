Instead of keeping track of simulations manually using notebooks and spreadsheets, Simvue helps to automate this
and provide a single view of all your simulations, post-processing jobs, ML training etc, no matter where in the
world they are running. Simvue can track and organise metadata and files, collect metrics and logs from running
simulations, as well as maintain connections between different simulations.
