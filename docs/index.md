Instead of keeping track of simulations or any realtime processing task manually using notebooks and spreadsheets, Simvue helps to automate this
and provide a single view of all your simulations, processing jobs, ML training etc, no matter where in the world they are running. 

Simvue can track and organise metadata and files, collect metrics and logs from running
simulations or any processing tasks, as well as maintain connections between different simulations and tasks and is even inter-operable between different platforms.
