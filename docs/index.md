# Welcome

Instead of keeping track of simulations by hand using notebooks and spreadsheets, Simvue helps to automate this
and provide a single view of all your running and completed simulations. Simvue can keep track of input parameters
and files, collect metrics, logs and files from running simulations, as well as maintain connections between
different simulations.
