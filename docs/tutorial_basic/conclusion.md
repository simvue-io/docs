# Conclusion
This concludes our tutorial of how to use Simvue! 

## What We Covered
Hopefully, you have learned how to:

- Create and configure a run
- Add metadata and tags to the run, and update them during code execution
- Create and configure folders to store Simvue runs
- Define metrics about the script which are monitored in real time
- Monitor resource utilization metrics during code execution
- Log events, catch exceptions and add support for the Python logging module
- Save artifacts, which can be retrieved after the script finishes running
- Add alerts which can warn the user if things go wrong during script execution
- Retrieve information about your runs stored on the Simvue server
- Retrieve data from a run including events, artifacts and metrics
- Plot data retrieved from a run

## Further Examples
This tutorial only scratched the surface of the kinds of things you can achieve with Simvue! For more examples,
see the [^^Examples^^](/examples/tensorflow/) section of the documentation.

For more advanced functionality of Simvue, including adding processes to be able to begin and stop simulations automatically, or use Multiparser to track simulations which are not Python based, [^^see the second tutorial here^^](/tutorial_advanced/introduction)
