# Conclusion
This concludes our tutorial of how to use Simvue! 

## What We Covered
Hopefully, you have learned how to:

- Create and configure a run
- Add metadata and tags to the run, and update them during code execution
- Create and configure folders to store Simvue runs
- Define metrics about the script which are monitored in real time
- Monitor resource utilization metrics during code execution
- Log events, catch exceptions and add support for the Python logging module
- Save artifacts which are stored can be retrieved after the script finished running
- Add alerts which can warn the user if things go wrong
- Retrieve information about your runs stored on the Simvue server
- Retrieve data from a run including events, artifacts and metrics
- Plot data retrieved from a run
