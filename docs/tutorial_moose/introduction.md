# Introduction

## Welcome
Welcome to the second tutorial on how to use Simvue, which uses the techniques covered in the first tutorial, as well as some more advanced functionality. This tutorial focusses on an example simulation using MOOSE (Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment), which is an open-source, parallel finite element framework for solving various Physics problems. In this tutorial we will define a simple problem, briefly discuss how to set up the MOOSE input file to solve this problem, and use the Simvue Multiparser to track the progress of the simulation. If you have not done so yet, we recommend that you [^^work through the first tutorial before attempting this one^^](/tutorial/introduction).
## Setup Simvue
This setup step is the same as in the first tutorial, so you can [^^skip to the next step^^](#setup-moose) if you have already completed that tutorial.
### Create a virtual environment

Run the following commands to create and activate a new virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### Install

Install the Python client:
```
pip install simvue
```

### Configuring Simvue

The next step is to specify the URL of the Simvue server and provide an access token used to authenticate to the server.

Login to the web UI, go to the **Runs** page and click **Create new run**. Create a file called `simvue.ini` containing
the contents as provided.
The file should look something like:
```
[server]
url = https://app.simvue.io
token = eyJ0eXAi...
```

## Setup MOOSE and Paraview
### Install MOOSE
Next you will need to setup MOOSE on your computer. [^^See the installation instructions here^^](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/index.html), using the link corresponding to your operating system. 

You will also need to create your MOOSE application - [^^see the instructions for creating a MOOSE application here^^](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/new_users.html). You will not need to enable any extra Physics modules for this tutorial, so can leave the Makefile with the default values.

### Install Paraview
If you would like to see the solution generated by the MOOSE script, you will also want CAD software to view the output. Paraview is an open source program which can be used, [^^which can be downloaded here^^](https://www.paraview.org/download/). While this is not strictly necessary to follow along with the tutorial, it may give you a better picture of what the MOOSE simulation is doing.
